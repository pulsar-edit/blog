## What is new in 1.112.1?

Hotfix for important functionality within PPM.
During recent refactoring of the PPM package, a bug was accidentally introduced that made it impossible for any package maintainer to publish a new package (or to publish new versions of their existing packages).
An update was needed within PPM to restore this functionality to expected working order.

Includes these PRs: https://github.com/pulsar-edit/ppm/pull/116 and https://github.com/pulsar-edit/ppm/pull/118 to fix the issue.

See the [v1.112.0](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/releases/tag/v1.112.0) release for all the other changes since v1.111.0.
