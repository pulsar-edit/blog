# The next Pulsar Release 1.102.0!

With the release of Pulsar 1.102.0 we have packed it full of improvements!

With a huge focus on testing this time around we hope that this will result in a more stable and functional editor in all future releases.

We've also added new icons for macOS and updated many of Pulsar and core packages dependencies.

But for the big news, our macOS releases are now signed! Meaning no fancy commands need to be run prior to installation and you get a guarantee that Pulsar is made and published by us. Also as you might've noticed, this version has no `beta` in its name. We are now adopting a Rolling Release model and this can be considered the first of many stable releases. Take a look at our website for more information!

And again, special thank you to all of our wonderful community members that have helped us write code, log issues, respond to everyone, and donate to the project. We truly could not do this without each and every one of you.

And as always, happy coding, see you among the stars!
