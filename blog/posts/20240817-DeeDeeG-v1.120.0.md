## Pulsar 1.120.0: Keeping it clean!

This release is fully of housekeeping, fixes, Tree-sitter improvements and more.

Our icon on Windows got some TLC to look less crunchy! It should look better just about everywhere (on the taskbar, in the installer, Pulsar's window title bar, explorer context menu, you name it!)
There's our regular Tree-sitter improvements, like indentation improvements in JavaScript and Typescript, improved syntax highlighting in TypeScript, with general improvements to code folding, and new hackability on query files.
We've enhanced the functionality of the 'pulsar -p' switch for accessing 'ppm', and checked its correctness. No more printing the versions for Pulsar when you meant to print the version of 'ppm'! Arguments / subcommands should make it safely to 'ppm' as you intended. (On Windows -- enhancements will come to Linux and macOS soon™️!) Further with PPM stale dependencies have been removed and updated as needed.
We now handle indents/leading whitespace better for all the snippets users out there! Snippet fearlessly, now with proper indentation handling!
And, last but not least, we fixed a stray link in 'CONTRIBUTING.md'.

As always thanks a ton for all of the support for the project, and we look forward to seeing you amongst the stars.

\- The Pulsar Team
