- Added a Jasmine 2-based test runner, migrated core editor tests to use it. Packages bundled into the core editor can migrate their tests to use this as well, over time. The Jasmine 1 test runner remains available.
- Added `--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform` and `--ozone-platform=wayland` as parameters when running under Wayland on Linux (avoids using xwayland, which causes rendering problems on some systems, especially with NVidia)
- Many Tree-sitter/parser/grammar improvements.
  - Updated to `web-tree-sitter` version `0.25.3`.
  - Fixed a bug preventing folds from updating after code changes in some scenarios.
  - Better folding behavior in Python.
  - Better folding and syntax highlighting in Ruby of `case`/`in` statements.
  - Better syntax highlighting of private members in JavScript.
  - Better folding of multiline comments in PHP.
- Updated the `read` dependency in ppm
