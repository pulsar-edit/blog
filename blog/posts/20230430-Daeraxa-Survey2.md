A short survey asking for community feedback on a couple of aspects of the project

<!-- more -->

Due to the success of the first survey we have decided to use this format again to seek community opinion on a couple of elements of the project.

In particular we are looking for feedback on some Pulsar UI changes, our documentation and publishing community packages.

**_There is no need to sign into any account to respond to this survey and no personal data is being collected (emails, names etc.)._**
