## Pulsar v1.124.0: Happy Year-End Festivities!

We hope you're having a relaxing and wholesome holiday season! We've been kicking back a bit ourselves, but that doesn't mean we don't have any new updates to share with you!

Whether you're celebrating end-of-year holidays in the cold of Winter, or the heat of Summer (depending on what hemisphere you live in!) Pulsar is here to warm your heart with another Regular release.

We've made it possible for spellcheck to activate in more fine-grained scopes, and turned it on for code comments by default. _(Now with fewer typos in comments!)_ If you'd like to disable spell checking in comments, navigate to `Settings > spell-check > grammars` and remove `source comment`, or delete `source comment` from `spell-check.grammars` in your config file.

We've tweaked and refined some aspects of our Tree-sitter usage, as usual. With a fix for C++, and another under-the-hood fix as well.

We've ensured that keybinds should show for every package in `settings-view`, fixing a bug that prevented any keybinds from showing when keybinds were available for OSes/platforms other than the one currently in use.

We've cleaned up an outdated error message that you might see when moving items to the trash on Linux.

And we've engaged in a bit of maintenance around our CI operations as usual, and made building Pulsar a bit faster by skipping generation of blockmap files that we currently don't make use of.

As always, a huge thank you to our community, contributors, and donations.
Happy coding, and see you amongst the stars.
\- The Pulsar Team
