- Python 3.12+ compatibility in ppm (installing packages with native C/C++ modules with Python 3.12+ on your system should Just Workâ„¢). (Python 3.7 and older no-longer supported for installing Pulsar packages with native C/C++ modules with ppm. Does not affect anything other than installing certain Pulsar packages.)
- PHP arrays spanning multiple lines are now foldable, as they always should have been.
- Various dependency updates for ppm.
- `core.allowWindowTransparency` setting is now hidden from the UI, as it has many limits and can cause unexpected issues, a situation which we inherit from the upstream Electron project. (Power-users who understand the drawbacks and still wish to enable transparency can add it to their user config files manually.)
