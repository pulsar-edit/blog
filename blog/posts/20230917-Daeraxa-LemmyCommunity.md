During the Reddit blackout a couple of months ago, we had a lot of interest in the creation of an official Lemmy community in combination with our Subreddit. After checking things again with a vote, we have decided to officially open our Lemmy instance.

So if you like the Reddit style format but would prefer federation and open source software, then come and join us at [pulsaredit@lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/pulsaredit)!

With this, we expand upon our existing presence in the fediverse ([@pulsaredit@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@pulsaredit)) and hope that we can grow the community in these spaces.

If you are new to Lemmy or the fediverse in general, it is important to understand that you don't _need_ to join the instance that the community is hosted on. In the case of Lemmy, our instance is on https://lemmy.ml/, but you can join pretty much any community you like and still fully interact with the `pulsaredit` community - this is what federation is all about. If you don't have a Lemmy account, then you can go to [https://join-lemmy.org/](https://join-lemmy.org/instances) to help you find a community that caters to your interests.

Once you have made your Lemmy account (or already have one), you can join the community by searching for `!pulsaredit@lemmy.ml` from within your instance's search, clicking the community name, and hitting `Subscribe` in the top right.
