Hotfix: Pulsar 1.107.1 is [available now!](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/releases/tag/v1.107.1)

<!-- more -->

## What is new in 1.107.1?

Hotfix for important cosmetic issues in the bundled `github` package.
This package missed updates to be compatible with the breaking changes in Less Style Sheet syntax, and needed to be updated to preserve the intended styling of the GitHub and Git panes.

Includes this PR: [#639](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/639) to fix this issue: [#638](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/issues/638)

See the [v1.107.0](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/releases/tag/v1.107.0) release for all the other changes since v1.106.0.
