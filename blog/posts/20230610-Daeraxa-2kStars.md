We just hit 2000 stars on GitHub!

<!-- more -->

This is just a quick blog post to say thank you to everyone in our wonderful community who have allowed us to get this far. I know it is "just" a number but 2000 stars shows us just how many people believe in our project.

It is hard to believe this project is almost nearing a year old. The [pulsar-edit/pulsar](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar) repository was created on the 12th of July 2022 and in that time we have already done so much and we look forward to doing so much more.

Here is a chart generated on [star-history.com](https://star-history.com/) showing our stars over time.

So again, a huge thank you to everyone, particularly our wonderful community and our generous donors who make this project possible.
