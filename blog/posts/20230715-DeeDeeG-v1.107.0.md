Fresh off the CI press: Pulsar 1.107.0 is [available now!](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/releases/tag/v1.107.0)

## What is new in 1.107.0?

Another month and another Pulsar release! This month features a bunch of those all important quality-of-life updates. We have a whole host of bugfixes and upgrades for you along with a sprinkling of new features.

To kick things off we have now resolved an issue which has been hanging around since we began this project. As we no longer had the same method of installing the software as Atom, we created an issue for Windows users where the `pulsar` and `ppm` were not being added to PATH. The upshot of this was some rather important Pulsar features were no longer working by default on Windows - namely the ability to launch pulsar by just running `pulsar` in run or cmd/powershell (you can find more in our [launch manual](https://pulsar-edit.dev/docs/launch-manual/sections/getting-started/#opening-modifying-and-saving-files) on how you can use this to open Pulsar directly to a particular file, line and even column). You can also run `pulsar --help` to display all the available options.

Please note that whilst we have this working now for the most part, the `-p`/`--package` option as well as `ppm` still needs some more development work. However until this has been completed you can still access Pulsar package management from the command line on Windows by simply using `apm` (what `ppm` is still named underneath) in place of those commands.

Next we have an update to our `less-cache` package which bumps the version of [less](https://lesscss.org/) used by Pulsar from `3.12.2` to `4.1.3` which adds some new functionality but also introduces a breaking change regarding using division in math expressions. The good news is that Pulsar will automatically attempt to fix those issues during load. You can read more about this in our recent [community update blog post](https://pulsar-edit.dev/blog/20230701-Daeraxa-JulyUpdate.html#less-cache-package-update) on this subject.

To continue the trend of new developments with the modern [Tree-sitter implementation](https://pulsar-edit.dev/blog/20230601-Daeraxa-JuneUpdate.html#tree-sitter-updates-are-live), we now have a new grammar for `TOML` files as well as a couple of fixes to some issues that have been discovered with the new implementation.

Another nice feature recently added is a new API endpoint - `atom.versionSatisfies()`. No longer do package maintainers (or any other Pulsar hacker) need to write their own way of checking for Pulsar versions, we now have an inbuilt way of doing it which will hopefully alleviate some of the problems we have seen with some packages using (let's just say) "less-than-ideal" methods of version checking. You can read more about it on the [PR](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/588).

And lastly, in case you missed it from the community update, we have resolved an issue due to a downstream dependency that was causing Pulsar to get falsely flagged by virus checkers. You can read more about this from the [update post](https://pulsar-edit.dev/blog/20230701-Daeraxa-JulyUpdate.html#antivirus-es5-ext-issue).

And that brings us to a close for the `1.107.0` release notes. As ever a huge thank you to our wonderful donors and community members who not only make this project possible but worthwhile.

Until next time, happy coding and see you amongst the stars!

### Changelog

- Fixed a number of issues with the experimental modern Tree-sitter grammar mode
- Pulsar can now be added to the PATH on Windows, via the "System" pane within Settings View.
- Bumped `less-cache` to `v2.0.0` which uses `less@4.1.3`. This adds many new features of Less, while causing breaking changes to existing Less StyleSheets. Read more about these changes [here](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/less-cache/releases/tag/v2.0.0). Pulsar will attempt to automatically repair any breaking changes in any package style sheets, while emitting deprecations.
- Fixed a bug that would render files unable to be clicked with sticky headers enabled on One-Dark and One-Light themes.
- Added a Modern Tree-Sitter TOML Grammar.
- Added a new API endpoint within Pulsar of `atom.versionSatisifes()` to allow packages to safely check the version of Pulsar, instead of having to do so themselves.
- An issue in a downstream dependency has been resolved that improperly flagged Pulsar as malicious.
