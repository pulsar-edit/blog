Armed with a big ol' can of Raid: Pulsar [1.110.0](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/releases/tag/v1.110.0) is available now!

## What do we have for you in Pulsar 1.110.0?

Here we are with another Pulsar release, and this month we have quite a number of fixes and improvements. This time around, the focus has really been on bug fixes in order to improve the overall experience.

Starting with changes to PPM (Pulsar Package Manager), it has been updated to use a newer version of `node-gyp` (a tool for compiling native modules for node.js), which will allow use of newer C/C++ compiler toolchains as well as newer versions of Python, namely 3.11, which introduced an issue for PPM requiring downgrading to 3.10. For Windows users, it also now supports Visual Studio 2022! We previously covered (part of) this topic in one of our community update [blog posts](https://pulsar-edit.dev/blog/20230801-Daeraxa-AugustUpdate.html#moving-ppm-to-our-own-npm-fork) in a bit more detail, so be sure to have a read of that too.

On the topic of PPM, the decaffeination (conversion of CoffeeScript to JavaScript) has now been completed thanks to community members [@nemokosch/@twocolours](https://github.com/twocolours) & [@GuilleW](https://github.com/GuilleW). In the [last release](https://pulsar-edit.dev/blog/20230916-Daeraxa-v1.109.0.html), we announced this had been completed in the core editor and packages; now this has been extended to PPM!

Onto Pulsar itself: we have a few new features that have been added. The first is a new autocomplete API that works on ranges rather than the previous prefix system, which will improve LSP support. (And on the topic of autocomplete, if anyone had been editing EJS files and noticed errors popping up, these have now been greatly reduced in this update).

Onto the fixes. This first one solves an issue where, if you attempted to start Pulsar with an invalid configuration file, then it would silently fail but still present a running process. Error checking has now been added so that the error can actually be exposed to the user.

Next, we have a problem introduced with our `snippets` package update, which now includes variables indicated by a `$`, which is also used by PHP, so some escaping of these characters needed to be added.

And lastly, we had a problem with macOS binary signing in version '1.109.0'; this was already covered in the last [community update](https://pulsar-edit.dev/blog/20231004-Daeraxa-OctoberUpdate.html#macos-binary-signing-issues), and now this fix applies to our regular releases.

And that just about covers things for this release. We hope you have enjoyed reading this and continue to enjoy using Pulsar. As ever, a huge thank you to our generous donors and community, without whom this project would not be possible.

Until next time, happy coding, and see you amongst the stars!
