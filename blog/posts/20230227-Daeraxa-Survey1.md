A short survey asking how you heard about the Pulsar project as well as feedback
on our community and social presence.

<!-- more -->

We are curious to see where people are finding out about the project and also
where people are looking for news, updates and information.

If this goes well we may look at doing further community surveys on other
aspects of Pulsar.

There is no need to sign into any account to respond to this survey and no
personal data is being collected (emails, names etc.).

[You can find the Survey (Google Forms) here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxbP1gkvjOJ3JkdSiQm5AvBg2tqpnXZO3GxW0J6cDRlV6PJw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
